Spring Boot tutorial that I am following:
                http://www.java2novice.com/spring-boot/
                

1.  To run spring boot through command line- 
        You will need to build the jar file first. Here is the syntax to run the main class from a jar file.
              1st step:  java -jar path/to/your/jarfile.jar fully.qualified.package.Application
              2nd step:  mvn package && java -jar target/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar
              3rd step:  curl localhost:8080/readiness 
        Also you can pass configuration related properties through command line as shown below. One of the property in the command line 
        is changing server port to 9090.
              java -jar command-line.jar \
                    --server.port=9090 \
                    --site.name=java2novice.com


       
2.  What will spring boot make: Jar file or War File?   
        Jar

3.  If we are using Spring Boot application, then You will see a new set of RESTful end points added to the application. 
    These are management services provided by Spring Boot. For eg:
        /error
        /actuator/health
        /actuator/info
        /actuator
        /actuator/shutdown
  
4. How to run spring boot as a standalsone application(non-web)?
        In spring boot, we need to implement CommandLineRunner interface and override run() method to create standalone application.
        Since we are creating standalone application, include only "spring-boot-starter" in the pom.xml file. Since it implements 
        CommandLineRunner interface, So run() method would be the entry point for the code.
